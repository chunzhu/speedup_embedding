# speedup_embedding
speedup embedding calculation through matrix calculation instead of loop

# purpose to speed up loop calculation
using matrix instead of loops to speed up calculation

# Findings
it did speeds up calculation.
There is another way to do matrix calculation, using numpy vectorise function. Maybe i should try that one day.
